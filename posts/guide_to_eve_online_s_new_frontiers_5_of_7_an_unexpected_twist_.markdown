Guide to EVE Online's "New Frontiers (5 of 7) An Unexpected Twist"
==================================================================

Woah, long title. Sorry for posting something so out of line with my normal
set of Ruby-related posts, but this was difficult enough that I thought it was
worth sharing my experience with.

EVE Online
----------

If you don't play [EVE Online](http://eve-online.com "EVE Online, a badass MMORPG spaceflight simulator"),
you should totally check it out - there's a 14 day free trial (30 days if you
have a Windows machine and use [Steam](http://steampowered.com "Steam, PC Gaming 'nexus'")
to sign up, or so I've heard)... but in my humble opinion, that's not really
enough time to *try out* EVE. This game has a [*ridiculous* learning curve](http://bloodeagles.com/images/LearningCurve.jpg "Artist's rendition of EVE's insane learning curve"),
and it takes a lot more than 14 days to get past the insanely-confused part of
your relationship with EVE. I was pissed at it for the first month, but I kept
at it because my friend was bugging me to play it with him, and now I'm
totally in love.

The mission
-----------

Anyway, enough with the plugging - I'm not on staff, I just love the game, I
swear! Since you're here, I assume you want to run the infamous 5th mission in
the **New Frontiers** chain. This particular mission has a well-earned bad
reputation, and is considered by many to be harder than any other 3rd level
mission. In my personal opinion, it's harder than many *4th* level missions if
you do it wrong (aka, the way I did it the first two times around - I lost two
t2 fitted [Maelstroms](http://games.chruker.dk/eve_online/item.php?type_id=24694 "Maelstrom - Minmatar Battleship"),
and my mates who were helping me with it lost two t2 fitted [Abaddons](http://games.chruker.dk/eve_online/item.php?type_id=24692 "Abaddon - Amarr Battleship")
and [Drakes](http://games.chruker.dk/eve_online/item.php?type_id=24698 "Drake - Caldari Battlecruiser")
respectively); but it's perfectly manageable if you take your time and
prepare.

The summary of this mission is this - go in, kill shit, [boss][] spawns, kill
boss, and return with item. Doesn't sound hard - but the thing is, if you
actually fight all the enemies in this mission, they're rape you. Really,
really rape you. As an example, I was running this with a few friends, and one
of them was tanking in an [Abaddon](http://games.chruker.dk/eve_online/item.php?type_id=24692 "Abaddon - Amarr Battleship")
with 6 [T2 1600mm plates](http://games.chruker.dk/eve_online/item.php?type_id=20353 "1600mm Reinforced Steel Plates II"),
lending over 45,000 total HP. We let it aggro the entirety of the mission's
drones, and it was popped in a little under... 2 minutes, if I recall
correctly (remember, this is just a level three mission!).

Anyway, It's a bitch, to say the least, but it's do-able. The key is not to
get into a situation where you are facing all of the drones - in fact, you
don't have to *ever* worry about a majority of them. The vast majority of the
drones are tied to spawn triggers on the destruction of the
[neut](http://www.battleclinic.com/eve_online/item_database.php?id=i27953&tab=attributes "Drone Energy Neutralizer Sentry I"),
[missile](http://www.battleclinic.com/eve_online/item_database.php?id=i18033&tab=attributes "Drone Light Missile Battery"), and
[stasis](http://www.battleclinic.com/eve_online/item_database.php?id=i27956&tab=attributes "Drone Stasis Tower") towers.
As long as you can deal with the effect of these towers without destroying
them, you don't need to worry about a good 80-90% of the mission's intended
enemies.

However, you'll still have to face a substantial complement of drones - both
before and after you take out [the boss][boss]. I suggest a friend in a
battleship configured for passive tanking (don't depend on cap in any way -
the plentiful neut towers are quite efficient at keeping your cap completely
empty most of the time).

Another tip if you absolutely *need* capacitor, is to take in some extra
drones, burn out of the range of the missile batteries (100km was enough for
me), and then abandon the drones. The neuts will aggro to the drones, which
don't care about the cap, leaving you with no neuts to worry about for the
rest of the mission.

There's some warp scrambling drones on this mission (that's what really caught
me the first two times around), but I don't think you need to worry about them
if you're being careful as described here - I never saw one the last run
around, and I believe all the drones with warp scrambling ability are tied to
the tower-kill triggers, so they shouldn't be a problem if you don't touch the
towers (as described above). Might not hurt to carry a stab or two on the
ships you bring in, though.

As for dealing with the drones you *are* stuck with, it's not that hard -
bring lots of drones of your own, I personally brought in Light Scouts,
[Acolytes](http://games.chruker.dk/eve_online/item.php?type_id=2205 "Acolyte II")
specifically, because I thought they'd have a higher chance of hitting a bunch
of other drones. They seemed to work pretty well, though Medium Scouts might
not be a bad choice either. Whatever you do bring in, bring a drone bay full,
even if you can't field that many - sometimes the mission drones will target
yours, and then yours're dead. Have several 'volleys' with you. For your own
fittings, consider short-ranged weapons, as you'll spend most of your time
targeting the little buggers. In my experience, by the time they're targeted,
they're within 15km, so blasters, autocannons, and pulse lasers are a must.
Also consider carrying a loadout of smaller weapons than normal - my mate's
Abaddon was fitted with [cruiser-classed pulse lasers](http://games.chruker.dk/eve_online/item.php?type_id=3512 "Focused Medium Pulse Laser II"),
and he had a much easier time raping drones than I did with my normal loadout
of [battleship-classed arties](http://games.chruker.dk/eve_online/item.php?type_id=2961 "1400mm Howitzer Artillery II")
(for obvious reasons).

Once you have mostly dealt with the first wave of drones (they don't appear right
when you warp in, you have to sit there and enjoy watching the neut towers
rape your capacitor for a while before they begin to appear), the [boss][]
will appear. He's not all that difficult to deal with - he deals little to no
damage himself, though he does take a little while to go down (especially if
you're fitted as described above with light drones and cruiser weapons, to be
at maximum effectiveness against the mission drones). Once he does die,
another wave of mission drones spawns, but you don't really have to deal with
them - just get [the mission item](http://eve-online.itemdrop.net/eve_db/items/Commodity/miscellaneous/hive_mind_cpu "Hive Mind CPU")
from the cargo container dropped when you destroy the [boss][], and warp on
home (in my experience, this second non-tower-spawn group doesn't contain any warp
scramers either).

Finally... Best of luck to you on this mission... may you not lose the
towering stacks of ISK that I did on this mission. Oh, and R.I.P, my first two
poor, poor Maelstroms. You never deserved what this mission did to you.
