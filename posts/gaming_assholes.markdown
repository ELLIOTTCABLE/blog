Gaming assholes
===============

Short post, after all that flood of excessively long ones (well, what can ya do when there's just a shitload of information to).

Just got back on [EVE Online](http://eve-online.com "EVE Online") - I'm accustomed to logging in on my Mac Pro, as I like having a lot of workspace in-game (30" screen works great for having a bunch of in-game windows open while trading/mining/pricing, such as the market, calculator, notepad, multiple browser windows, multiple chat windows, the item info window, and so on)... but since it's [broken](mac_pro_epic_fail.xhtml "Mac Pro epic fail"), I'm logging on with my Macbook Pro.

Anyway, my 30 days of having to be automatically joined to the Rookie Chat channel has ended, so I wasn't in there, but I joined the normal 'Help' channel to ask some questions about mining barges. I learned what I wanted to rather quickly, but I stayed in, as there was a somewhat interesting argument going on. I saw the same thing I see quite often in gaming chat channels, or indeed, anywhere on the internet - assholes being themselves, and then self-righteous assholes complaining about the original assholes. This is usually the point where the elliottcable asshole butts in to point out that the self-righteous assholes are making more noise in the channel complaining about the original asshole than the original asshole was making. Meta much?

Another common observation of mine - most of these systems contain some permutation of the `/ignore` function, but this almost always turns out to be nearly pointless, as people having used said command end up causing more heartache for others in the channel than the original user causing the problem. This is because they usually use at least three different messages to let everyone else know that they ignored the person, thus doubling that person's 'annoyance impact' in the channel. The more annoying the person inciting the incidents, the more people bragging about having ignored him - thus the more of a doubling effect this feature has on that person's impact on the channel.

At some critical level of annoyance, a person ignoring the original person will see just as much spam from people having ignored him, as they saw from him himself.

It's an interesting phenomenon, and one I have no idea how to remedy using technological methods.
