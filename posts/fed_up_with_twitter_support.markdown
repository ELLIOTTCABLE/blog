Fed Up with Twitter Support

To all of you, your support is appreciated!

Okay, this is … really trying. I'm not sure where to start. Let's get this out
on the table first of all: Twitter's support team … is gone. There have been
numerous postings to the only public support system they have by people with
the same problem as me: support requests having been unanswered for weeks,
months, and in at least one case, a year.

This is patently ridiculous. I mean, I don't mind waiting a week or two for a
non-urgent support request to be filled, but a month and a half? Even worse,
having the support system declare my request so important as to be _discarded_?
Come the fuck on.

Now for a little story.

A Little Story
--------------
Once upon a time, a good friend of mine (named [@Bluebie][]) wrote an
interesting little web application named [Talkie][]. I really liked it, and
decided to open it up to a new market: [Twitter][]. I went and wrote an
interesting little bot, just for that interesting little web application, that
could create invisible and anonymous Talkie rooms for a group of people on
Twitter. This bot would watch the twitter feed for several 'key hashtags' that
were constructed to be easily worked into a tweet, such as [#GetARoom][],
[#TakeItToTalkie][], or [#TalkieMe][]; when it recognized a tweet, this cheery
little bot would provision a private chat room, just as fast as its little
metal robot fingers could, for the Twitter conversation to be continued in a
less restricted (\*cough\* a hundred and forty characters \*cough\*) medium.

Now, when I went to register a Twitter account for this interesting little bot,
I found that some fellow (\*cough\* wanker \*cough\*) had already registered
[@talkie][]. However, from what I could decipher of the T.O.S, that user was
prime for destruction. I didn't know how long it had been registered at that
point (now, as you'll see below, we can be sure it's been registered for at
least a month and a half), but I did know that it had zero followers,
followees, and updates. I registered [@TalkieMe][] to run the bot under in the
meantime, and proceeded to open a [Twitter support][] request, as follows:

> We're trying to write a Twitter bot for our new chat service,
> <http://talkie.me/>, so that we can integrate Talkie into Twitter (allow
> people to create temporary insta-chatrooms to continue Twitter discussions
> in Talkie). However, the @Talkie username is taken, by somebody with zero
> followers, zero followees, and zero updates. Could you destroy that account
> / transfer it to me?
> 
> I'm not sure what your policy on getting rid of defunct accounts is, but I'd
> really appreciate it. I think Talkie will become a great service for Twitter
> users to continue their more intricate conversations! d-:

I quickly decided to provide some additional information, and posted the
following comment:

> Just so you can see what I'm going to be doing with the account, I've
> created a early beta of the bot and started it running on the @TalkieMe
> account.

This request was submitted on February 27th, at 11:43 PM.

I was fairly sure this would be handled within a week or two, and didn't
consider it a very big deal when it wasn't - after all, the bot wasn't seeing
all that much use, so I didn't worry.

  [@Bluebie]: <http://twitter.com/Bluebie> "An extraordinary pony!"
  [Talkie]: <http://talkie.me/> "Where nice, creative, and fun people go to chat"
  [Twitter]: <http://twitter.com/> "Where you never, ever get any support"
  [#GetARoom]: <http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23GetARoom>
  [#TakeItToTalkie]: <http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23TakeItToTalkie>
  [#TalkieMe]: <http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23TalkieMe>
  [@talkie]: <http://twitter.com/talkie> "Damned Twitter username squatter."
  [@TalkieMe]: <http://twitter.com/TalkieMe> "What an interesting little bot!"
  [Twitter support]: <http://help.twitter.com/> "The name is a lie, it doesn't exist, I swear."

First Disregard
---------------
Well, I visited the Twitter support page to see what was going on after a
while, only to find that the status had been changed from "unassigned" to
"solved". Excited, I rushed to register @Talkie … only to find the account
still existed, and hadn't been removed. Slightly annoyed, I posted this
comment (on March 15th, at 12:36 PM):

> This was marked as solved ... but it isn't. The account still exists.

I promptly forgot about the problem; posting a response to the support request
caused their system to re-open it, so I was (again) fairly sure that it would
be solved in a timely manner once a real person saw it.

How disappointed I was to be!

On March 21st, at 12:49 PM, the following update was posted, and my support
ticket was "deemed solved". Now, read this carefully, and let it sink in.

Uh. Let me get this straight. No human ever took a single look at my request …
but you think that my problem may have fixed itself in the time it took you to,
uh … not look at it?

Okay, this is complete bullshit. But … whatever. I'll do what I was instructed;
since none of the listed help articles helped me, and none of the listed
"known issues" had anything to do with my problem, I "let them know" by
submitting a new request with the updated details. Oh, wait, there were no
updated details, my situation hadn't changed in the slightest.

I proceeded to make the following new "support request", on March 21st, at
06:45 PM:

> We're trying to write a Twitter bot for our new chat service,
> <http://talkie.me/>, so that we can integrate Talkie into Twitter (allow

Needless to say, no action was taken by any human at Twitter.

Second Disregard
----------------
Hold on to your horses, it gets worse yet.

On April 4th, at 6:46 PM, two things happened: My second ticket was
"deemed solved", again by the "Support" username (not a human, in other words),
except that this time, there was no associated comment made on the support
request itself.

I also received the following email:

… woah. Okay, I'm going to go through that e-mail again, and dissect it a bit:

We Are Not Alone
----------------
Okay, this has gone too far. I started looking for other avenues to get the
support I needed; specifically, I was hoping for a phone number.

Instead, I came across Twitter's antiquated [Get Satisfaction][] [account][Twitter-GS], from
which they moved to [Zendesk][] (In retrospect, I'd guess they made this move
so that we couldn't see just how many support requests by other people were
going unanswered; in Zendesk, unlike Get Satisfaction, support requests are
private).

Does anybody else find it oddly appropriate, that since Twitter left Get
Satisfaction, I can no longer get satisfaction from Twitter support?

In any case, there's a big yellow header on the Get Satisfaction page that
says the following:

> Most recent Company Update (3 months ago):<br/>
> [Checking on old Support requests][]

Not one to leave any stone unturned, I immediately clicked the link. To my
surprise, that thread was packed with a flood of people having the same
problem as me:

The list goes on and on. After some more looking around,
[tons of other][threads-1] [Get Satisfaction threads][threads-2] are
complaining about the lack of any sort of response from Twitter:

- [Twitter support request still unassigned after 17 days](http://getsatisfaction.com/twitter/topics/twitter_support_request_still_unassigned_after_17_days)

Guess what? No Twitter response to any of these threads either.

Take Action
-----------
I ask that anyone reading this please, please provide support for my cause -
for all of our causes - by re-tweeting a link to this post, or digging /
redditing it. Twitter needs to realize that we won't take this bullshit for
very long.

Any support (heh) here is much, much appreciated.

Commentary
----------
[@yonderboy][] raised [a perfectly valid point][yonderboy-tweet] on Twitter:

I fully recognize the "you get what you pay for" argument. I'm not paying
anything to use Twitter, after all; what right do I have to demand support?

What one must realize here, is that Twitter is claiming to provide support by
*having* a support site in the first place. If they claimed "this is a free
service, provided without any support whatsoever", I'd understand. Even if
they simply silently didn't offer any sort of support system, I'd probably be
ticked, but move on. What really pisses me off is the fact that they proffer
support in the form of <http://help.twitter.com>, and then fail to follow
through on the time I invested in submitting a ticket.

Another thing worth noticing is the fact that Twitter's raised a ton of money
in multiple rounds of funding. That money should be going somewhere useful.
I'm sure a lot of it goes towards hardware and maintenance and bandwidth; but
with the support situation as it currently is, IMHO quite a bit more should be
put towards support staff than currently must be.
