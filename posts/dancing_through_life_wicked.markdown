Dancing Through Life - Wicked
=============================

    The trouble with schools is
    they always try to teach the wrong lesson
    believe me,
    I've been kicked out of enough of them
    to know
    they want you to become less callow
    less shallow
    but I say:
    "why invite stress in?"
    stop studying strife,
    and learn to live -
    the unexamined life!

    Dancing through life
    skimming the surface
    gliding where turf is smooth…
    Life's more painless
    for the brainless
    Why think too hard?
    When it's so soothing?
    Dancing through life…
    no need to tough it…
    when you can sluff it off as I do!
    Nothing matters,
    but knowing nothing matters -
    it's just life,
    so keep dancing through…

    Dancing through life,
    swaying and sweeping,
    and always keeping cool.
    Life is fraughtless -
    when you're thoughtless -
    those who don't try,
    never look foolish!
    Dancing through life,
    mindless and careless, 
    make sure your where less trouble is rife
    woes are fleeting,
    blows are glancing,
    when you're dancing
    through life…
