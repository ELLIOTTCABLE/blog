I think my working motivations, when it comes to programming (or, more
specifically, web application programming), are slightly odd. At least,
they're not what you usually see. When it comes to these things, I find myself
most interested not in the money coming from the business of running a
successful web application, nor in the possible fame within some communities
from running such… I think, in a large part, it comes from the chance to
possibly  watch a community of users evolve around it. I've been involved in
several such communities over the years (various forums, wikis, chat channels,
and web applications), and the community dynamics have always intrigued me.

Since I've dug further into programming, I've come across multiple instances
where I've thought a small tweak one way or another in some part of a specific
*technical implementation* should be able to tweak the entire community
dynamic that's formed in a specific way. To put it another way, I think that
often tiny changes in the code (both programming and design) behind a tool can
visibly affect the way that people interact using that tool.

Let's take an example. Say we come across a tiny ancient civilization living
among the rainforests. Let's say we've decided to give them a single tool, and
then leave them be, while studying them from a distance. Let's give them… a
small shovel. We watch as they reproduce this shovel and distribute it among
their community, and possession comes to be seen as a status indicator of
sorts, communicating one's grasp of wealth and community respect. The more
worn your shovel, the more you can be seen to have used it, and the more
respected you are as having contributed to the community.

Now suppose we change the initial situation a little—instead of a plain
shovel, let us sharpen the edges a little. A minor change, yes? And yet
suddenly, one of the villagers discovers you can cut yourself with the
shovel—perhaps even others! Not this time do we see possession of the shovel
become a symbol of respect and contribution, now it symbolizes a vindictive
desire to cause pain, and it garners power through fear. You don't mess with
the guy with a shovel. All this, from a physically minute design decision!

What would be different if we showed this closed community a mallet? What
about a wheel? These considerations map just as well to modern communities,
internet communities, as they do to this hypothetical backwater village. This
fact and it's implications interest me greatly.

Shiichan
--------
I'm obviously not the first person to consider this stuff. Possibly the first
time I considered any of this, was when I came across [this article][shiichan]
on similar topics. It discusses a piece of software called "Shiichan" (and
software similar to it), which may be used to power sites like [2chan.net][]
("Futaba Channel"), [4chan.org][], [7chan.org][], and other "[imageboards][]".
Other similar pieces of software include [futaba][] (the original),
[Futallaby][], and [Wakaba][] — there’s even an
[imageboard dedicated to discussing the culture of imageboards][metaboard]!

Anyway, that was a bit off topic. Imageboards really aren't my point
here—they've simply had a lot of time and practice perfecting one approach to an
online community. Their reputation around the internet is very different from
the reputation of normal forums, simply because they made one little
decision—they allow fully anonymous posting by anybody. This simply proves and
cements my point from above, that the smallest of technical choices can
cause quite major changes in the community congregates around the system in
which those choices were made.
