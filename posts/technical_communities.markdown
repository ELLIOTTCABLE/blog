Technical communities
=====================

    10:15:26 <@zenspider> I wake up... and I come in here... and the FIRST thing I see is elliottcable being an obnoxious prick ... AGAIN. I don't know who lifted your ban, or why, but you sir are NOT a welcome element in this channel.
    10:15:34 -!- Fullmoon [n=Fullmoon@mailout.faxonline.at] has quit [Client Quit]
    10:15:59 -!- Symmetry- [i=Symmetry@host-static-92-114-165-252.moldtelecom.md] has joined #ruby-lang
    10:15:59 <@zenspider> I made it clear yesterday that I wasn't sure why your ban was lifted... but I let you stay, HOPING (stupidly) that maybe this time around you might have learned your lesson. 
    10:16:06 -!- Vardogr [n=Vardogr@wsip-70-164-105-18.sd.sd.cox.net] has joined #ruby-lang
    10:16:08 < elliottcable> … I'm helping people. And complaining about a channel, not this one, and then stopping doing so when I realized it may not be welcome to do so in here.
    10:16:08 <@zenspider> it is pretty clear that you have not.
    10:16:29 <@zenspider> so know this... I'll be back to reban you every time you show up.
    10:16:37 -!- mode/#Ruby-Lang [+b *!n=ec@ec2-75-101-138-129.compute-1.amazonaws.com] by zenspider
    10:16:41 -!- elliottcable was kicked from #ruby-lang by zenspider [Kicked]

This has bothered me for some time. I think this is, what, my fourth ban from
`#Ruby-Lang`? I have personal problems with “zenfag” as I'm prone to call him,
and I’ll attempt to refrain from bringing those into this discussion. What I
want to highlight here is what happened, in a general sense: somebody not
related to a technical project themselves had a personal problem with someone
also not related to said technical project, and used a specific means to
prevent the second person from contributing to (or learning from) that
community due to said personal problems.

I will out and admit that I’m an annoying person. Hell. Really annoying. In
social channels, I'd probably be considered a troll and get banned as well. My
point is that this very fact makes me the perfect example of my own argument -
if an op is going to go of the handle and ban somebody who isn't, in fact,
reducing the quality of the channel to users… that person will be me.

The best technical communities will be unmoderated - the assholes, the foreign,
the stupid - they all deserve help just as much as those that speak your
language fluently, kiss your ass, and understand exactly what you're
explaining to them every time. If you don't think so… then you, my friend,
are the problem.
