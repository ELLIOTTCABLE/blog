I’m In a Car
============

My roommate and I got bored, and modified the lyrics to The Lonely Island’s
[*I’m On a Boat*][video] with our own variation on the concept. I suggest you
follow along and sing our lyrics while watching the video, it's entertaining.

    [Intro (T-Pain)]
    (Shortayyyy) Awww, shit!
    Get cho’ seatbelts ready, it’s about to go down (shorty, yeah!)
    Everybody in the place hit the *fuckin’* road (shorty, yeah!)
    But stay on your *motherfuckin’* toes
    We runnin’ this, let’s go
    
    [Chorus (T-Pain)]
    I’m in a car (I’m in a car)
    I’m in a car (I’m in a car)
    Everybody look at me, ’cause I’m ridin’ in a car (ridin’ in a car)
    I’m in a car (I’m in a car)
    I’m in a car
    Take a good hard look at the motherfuckin’ car (car, yeah.)
    
    [The Lonely Island (T-Pain)]
    I’m in a car motherfucker, take a look at me
    Straight cruisin’ in a car on a long-ass street
    There’s a brand new road, runnin’ through the tar
    You can’t stop me, motherfucker, cause I’m in a car
    
    Take a picture, trick (trick) I’m in a car, bitch (bitch)
    We drinkin’ fuckin’ rock star, cause it’s so crisp (crisp)
    I got my drivin’ gloves, and my googlie-gogglies
    I’m spinnin’ donuts, you at Regal straight spinnin’ talkies
    
    I’m ridin on a ’cycle, doin’ flips and shit
    The ’cycle’s screechin’, gettin e’rybody all pissed
    But this ain’t NASCAR, this is real as it gets
    I’m in a car motherfucker, don’t you ever forget
    
    I’m in a car and … it’s goin fast and …
    I got a racin’ themed pashmina afghan
    I’m the king of the world, in a car like Le-oh
    If you’re on the bus, then you’re sho’ not me-oh
    
    Get the fuck up, this car is REAL!
    
    Fuck bikes, I’m in a car, motherfucker (motherfucker)
    Fuck chairs, I rock seats, motherfucker (motherfucker)
    I’m in the back with my boys, motherfucker (yeah)
    This car engine make noise, motherfucker
    
    Hey ma’, if you could see me now (see me now)
    Arms spread wide, out the sunroof now (sunroof now)
    Gonna fly this car to the moon somehow (moon somehow)
    Like Latrell Sprewell, anythin’ is possible
    
    [T-Pain]
    Yeah, never thought I’d be in a car
    It’s a big black rooooamin’ road (yeah)
    Saint Aaaaanthony! Look at me, oh (everybody, in the car!)
    Never thought I’d see the day
    When a fast car comin my way
    Believe me when I sayyyy, I fucked grease moonnkeyyyyy
    
    [Chorus (T-Pain)]
    I’m in a car (I’m in a car)
    I’m in a car (I’m in a car)
    Everybody look at me, ’cause I’m ridin’ in a car (ridin’ in a car)
    I’m in a car (I’m in a car)
    I’m in a car
    Take a good hard look at the motherfuckin’ car (car, yeah.)
    
    [T-Pain]
    Whoahhh
    Sha-sha-shorty, shorty
    Yeah yeah yeahhh
