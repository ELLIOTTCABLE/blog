Virus - Deltron 3030
====================

> <pre>I wanna devise a virus
> to bring dire straits to your environment,
> crush your corporations with a mild touch,
> trash your whole computer system and revert you to papyrus!
> I want to make a super virus,
> strong enough to cause blackouts in every single metropolis.
> 'Cause they dont wanna unify us
> So fuck it, total anarchy
> can't nobody stop us!</pre>
> 
> <pre>You see late in the evening,
> fucked up on my computer and my mind starts roaming...
> I create like a heathen -
> The first cycles of this virus I can send through a modem,
> infiltration hits your station,
> no Microsoft or enhanced DOS will impede...
> Society thinks they're safe when...
> bingo! Hard drive crashes from the rending
> A lot of hackers tried viruses before
> vaporizing your text like so much white-out.
> I want it where the file replication is a chore
> Lights out shut down the entire White House
> I don't want just a bug that could be corrected
> I'm erecting immaculate design
> Break the nation down section by section,
> even to the greatest minds, it's impossible to find!</pre>
