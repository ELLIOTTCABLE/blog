WebKit (Safari 3.1) and the CSS @font-face declaration
======================================================

I'm a big fan of typography in general. If you check out my [homepage](http://elliottcable.name) or my [contact elliottcable](http://elliottcable.name/contact.xhtml) page, and you're using Safari/WebKit or Opera/Kestrel, you'll notice the typefaces (fonts, as colloquialized) are *very* non-standard. As of this writing, I'm using [Museo][] and [Diavlo][] heavily on both.[^jos]



  [Museo]: <http://www.josbuivenga.demon.nl/museo.html> (Jos Buivenga's Museo free typeface)
  [Diavlo]: <http://www.josbuivenga.demon.nl/diavlo.html> (Jos Buivenga's free Diavlo typeface)
  [^jos]: These are fonts by [Jos Buivenga][jos], quite the amazing person. His (free) fonts are, uniquely, released for use on the web in `@font-face` declarations - unlike the vast majority of other (even free to download) typefaces, which have ridiculously restricting licenses and terms of use statements. Props, Jos - you're a pioneer, and deserve recognition as such.
